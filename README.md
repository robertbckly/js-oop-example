# Object-Oriented JavaScript Example

## About
This is my version of MDN's [JavaScript OOP tutorial project](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Adding_bouncing_balls_features), which I built in late-2021 when I was working to improve my JavaScript knowledge.

[Live demo](https://robertbckly.github.io/js-oop-example/)

## Instructions
- **With a keyboard:** use W-A-S-D or arrow keys to move the main ball and capture all the multicoloured balls.
- **Without a keyboard:** simply watch what happens.
